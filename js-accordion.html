        <div class="main">Uzumaki Naruto</div>
        <div class="content">For the first twelve years of his life, Naruto Uzumaki had to live a life without parents and endure the apparent unsolicited hate from the villagers of Konohagakure, never knowing what it was like to be loved or have friends as a result. One day, however, he learns from the covert ninja Mizuki that the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox was sealed within him soon after his birth and is the reason he is alone in the world. After this, Naruto's fortunes begin to change. In addition to finding a father-figure in Iruka Umino after defeating Mizuki, Naruto achieves his dream by finally becoming a ninja, his ultimate desire being to become the greatest in Konoha, the Hokage. In doing so, Naruto is added to Team 7 along with Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno under the leadership of Kakashi Hatake. To see whether or not the three are ready to become ninja, Kakashi administers a test to see if they have what it takes. Each fails independently, leading Kakashi to believe they will never become ninja.</div>
        
         <div class="main">The Worst Client</div>
        <div class="content">Kakashi advises the three to start focusing on the team's well-being instead of their own, and in doing so they are able to pass the test. As one of the team's first missions, they are assigned to escort a man named Tazuna to the Land of Waves. Along the way, the group is attacked by Zabuza Momochi, an assassin sent to kill Tazuna. Kakashi, with the help of Naruto, Sasuke, and his own Sharingan (写輪眼, lit. "Copy Wheel Eye", English manga: "Mirror Wheel Eye") eye, is able to defeat Zabuza. Before he can finish Zabuza off, however, a masked boy named Haku arrives to take him away. In preparation for another of Zabuza's attacks, Kakashi decides to train Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura.</div>
        
        <div class="main">Dreams</div>
        <div class="content">In an effort to get stronger, Naruto trains harder than Sasuke and Sakura. Though he catches up to both in terms of talent, exerting the extra effort leaves him fatigued. To allow him a chance to regain his energy, the rest of Team 7 goes on to escort Tazuna without him. Soon afterwards, however, they are attacked again by Zabuza and a masked Haku. Using his new training, Sasuke does battle with Haku and proves to be an equal match, forcing Haku to trap him in a prison of ice. Naruto quickly arrives to help and joins Sasuke in the fight, though both are soon overpowered. As Haku makes to finish Naruto off, Sasuke uses himself as a shield to block the attack and appears to be killed. Naruto, in his anger, taps into the dormant powers of the demon fox sealed within him.</div>
        
        <div class="main">Hero's Bridge</div>
        <div class="content">With the demon fox's power Naruto is easily able to defeat Haku. When Haku's mask breaks away, however, Naruto is unable to bring himself to kill the young boy beneath the mask. Elsewhere, Kakashi and Zabuza do battle. As Kakashi is about to kill Zabuza with his Lightning Blade, Haku takes the attack, saving Zabuza at the cost of his own life. Despite this turn of events Kakashi is still able to disable Zabuza, prompting the arrival of Zabuza's employer, Gato. When Gato orders his own personal army of thugs to kill Zabuza along with Tazuna and Team 7, Zabuza uses the last of his strength to kill Gato, avenging Haku's death before dying himself. With their mission complete, Team 7 and a revived Sasuke return to Konoha. Soon after returning home, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura are entered into the Chunin Exams, a chance for them to rise up the ninja ranks and test their abilities.</div>
